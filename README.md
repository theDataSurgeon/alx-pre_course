Orginially, this contained the text "My first readme" and i am going to leave it at that for now.
After a week of practise, all i can say is i am getting a hand of it.
In 5 years, i'll come back to check how far i have progressed in contributing to the science community.
Or what do you suggest my dearest reader?
